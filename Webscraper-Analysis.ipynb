    "-What was also noted was that half of the people being cutoff which was around 4 million were children. While children are not within the category of low income considering that they are not legally allowed to work for money Medicaid only considers children with severe disabilities so severing this help is extremely detrimental\n",
    "    WA expands Medicaid coverage for people nearing release from jails and prisons\n",
    "-Similar to the previous point of adding more people to be covered, having more people available for Medicaid to cover can potentially cause more dual eligibility issues since people who would be nearing release from jails would already have low income considering they wouldn't have a job yet and also the potential for life-threatening injuries that can form disabilities from their time in jail may make them eligibile to Medicare as well."
